“I can check if your birthday is a palindrome in all the formats listed below. 
~~~
dd-mm-yyyy,  dd-mm-yy
mm-dd-yyyy,  mm-dd-yy
yyyy-mm-dd,  yy-mm-dd
~~~
If it’s not a palindrome in one format, I’ll convert it to the above listed format. If it’s a palindrome in at least one of them, then your birthday will be treated as palindrome. I can also tell you the previous and next palindrome date as well as how far those days are.”
